Project Title: Image Caption Generator

Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for generating captions for presented images using computer vision and natural language processing.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for feature extraction from the input images. 
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used for sentence(caption) generation.

Dataset : Flickr8k containing 8k images with corresponding captions.
